# Comic Book Sales data using mySQL and webScaper

The [Grand Comics Database (GCD)](https://www.comics.org) provide a SQL data dump of all the comic books published all around the world. The data is quiet extensive but very well-organized given its depth and width.

The initial goal of the project was to gather comic book's sales data from [Comichron](http://www.comichron.com/) and merge it with __GCD__ to get insight on what drives sale when it gets to comic books. For the moment, I have collected the sale data and GCD separately but merging them requires some disambiguation, which I'm not so trilled about. But I'll come back to this soon!

Nonetheless, I've used the __GCD__ database as a playground to run some mysql queries and extract some insight about the extent and depth of the data. Also to code to scrape web for sales data is available.
